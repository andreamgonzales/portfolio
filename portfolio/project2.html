                The Thacher Gallery presents a collection of diverse and thoughtful art exhibitions that explore various artforms and aesthetics, spark conversation, and encourage audiences to reflect on the importance of community and social impact. Along with exhibitions that show emerging Bay Area artists and art collectives, the Thacher Gallery presents free public programs including artist talks, craft demonstrations, and educational speakers.

                </p>
                <p class="contextpara2">As a designer, I collaborate with curators from various art collectives such as <a href="https://www.prisonrenaissance.org/">Prison Renaissance</a>, <a href="https://relatedtactics.com/">Related Tactics</a>, and <a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/">Ear Hustle</a> to create print and digital advertisements for their exhibitions and events in collaboration with Thacher Gallery. These advertisements have been featured in San Francisco Arts Monthly, and have resulted in hundreds of attendees at our online art exhibitions and talks.

                <p class="contextpara2">Currently, I am working on designing a catalog to support our newest exhibition, <i>Pulled Apart</i>. For <i>Pulled Apart</i>, we have collaborated with 5 artists and the University of San Francisco&#39;s Engineering Program to focus on the use of the physical and cyber systems that are prevalent today.

                <p class="reflectionpara">
                Working at the Thacher Gallery as the designer for all of our exhibitions has allowed me to not only push my creative boundaries, but also enhance my soft skills such as collaboration, communication, and leadership. I&#39;ve learned to effectively lead conversations and work with different curators to create optimal designs that communicate their vision, which is something I will forever be grateful for. Being able to work with other people that have different styles than me has allowed me to grow creatively, and has taught me how to adapt easily in terms of art direction and style.

                <p class="reflectionpara2"> 
                During my work here, we&#39;ve collaborated with art collectives and organizations that emphasize the intersection of art and social justice, and the immense importance of the two. Through our exhibitions and events, I&#39;ve learned about the value of community and discussed various issues including mass incarceration, voting rights, and racial injustice. Working here has taught me that art can do so much more than satisfy self&#45;fulfillment&#59; it can unify, teach, and heal communities.
