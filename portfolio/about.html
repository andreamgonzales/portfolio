    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      
    <h2>Hi, I&#39;m Andrea Gonzales! &#40;she&#47;her&#41;</h2>
    <p> I'm a fourth&#45;year marketing and design student at the University of San Francisco. I grew up loving art of all forms, from oil painting, sculpting, crocheting clothes, to digital design. Prior to design, I was a nursing and psychology student who was taught that art was strictly a hobby. As a first generation Filipina, the idea of being either a nurse or nothing at all was instilled in my mind at an early age. During my sophomore year at my university, I realized that I didn&#39;t want to continue pursuing a career that I wasn&#39;t passionate and curious about. Since becoming a marketing major and design minor, my passion and drive to become a better designer each day continues to strenghten. Because I truly enjoy what I do, I take initiative to constantly learn and actively apply my skills and passion in my work. Although the transition from nursing and psychology to marketing and design was difficult, it was the best decision I&#39;ve ever made for myself and my future, and I hope to utilize my talents and passion to inspire other creatives.
        <br>
    I design to connect with others, create meaningful experiences, and promote inclusivity for all communities. Through design, I work towards creating for and with everyone in order to include all experiences, identities, and perspectives in our world.
        <br>
    I am currently seeking opportunities in visual design and&#47;or product design, where I can share my love for creating with others, so feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through email at andmgonzales&#64;gmail.com!</p>
