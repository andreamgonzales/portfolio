                <p class="ideationpara">
                For this assignment, I decided to design and develop a webpage for a Filipinx&#45;American food festival named, &#34;Busog Food Festival.&#34; I aimed to create a San Francisco based event that celebrates and unifies Filipinx culture and community through traditional and modern Filipinx food. Busog Food Festival invites the Bay Area to enjoy food from local Filipinx restaurants, providing a way for restaurant owners to effectively market their businesses and share their passion for food.

                </p>
                <p class="ideationpara2">I also had the idea of having 100&#37; of Busog Food Festival&#39;s ticket profits be donated to the National Alliance for Filipino Concerns &#40;NAFCON&#41;, a national alliance of Filipinx organizations that responds to the concerns of Filipinxs in the U.S. and Philippines. This idea came to mind since NAFCON was raising money to help those affected by the damaging typhoons in the Philippines that occurred in early November of 2020.

                 In my Visual Communications class, I first learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Learning how to program for the first time and understanding how to effectively communicate ideas through thoughtful web design gave me more insight about user interface and experiences, thus sparking my interest in UX&#47;UI design. Prior to this class, I mainly created print designs, branding assets, and digital advertisements. Having a more in depth understanding about website design has not only inspired me to strenghten my programming skills, but it also furthered my understanding of essential design principles to successfully communicate and connect with audiences through  intentional visual design and UX/UI design.
